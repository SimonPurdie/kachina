- The "Warm Earth" Color Palette

The style avoids sterile blacks and whites. Instead, it uses a rich, sun-drenched palette that feels organic yet vibrant.

    A light cream or parchment base background.

    Burnt orange, terracotta, and deep chocolate browns for dark elements to contrast with the light base.

    Cyan and a "Solar Yellow" for vibrant accents.

- Halftone & Texture Patterns

This is what gives the design its "street-style" or comic book flair.

    Halftone Dots: Use dot-pattern gradients in the corners of containers or as a transition between solid colors. Note that the "gradient" is achieved *with* halfttone dots rather than being applied to them. The dot pattern alignment should be dynamically angled, rather than aligning to standard cardinals or diagonals.

    Tribal/Geometric Patterns: The faint, light-orange "triangular" patterns in the background provide texture without being distracting.

- Typography Hierarchy

    The Hero Font: Use a heavy, blocky, "Impact-style" sans-serif for titles. Apply a thick outline (stroke) and a drop shadow that matches the accent color.

    The Header Font: For sub-headers use a cleaner, modern sans-serif with wide letter spacing to maintain readability.

    Body Text: Keep it simple. A standard, readable sans-serif works best, but use a dark brown instead of pure black to keep the "warmth."
